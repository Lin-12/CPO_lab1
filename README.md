1. Title: Computational Process Organization Lba1
2. List of group members: Chen Sihan 192050195  Yue Xueying 192050217
3. Laboratory work number: 3
4: Variant description: Binary-tree based set
5. Synopsis:
    1. add a new element (lst.add(3), cons(lst, 3), extend(lst, 3));
    2. remove an element (lst.remove(3), remove(lst, 3));
    3. size (lst.size(), size(lst));
    4. conversion from and to python lists (lst.to_list(), lst.from_list([12, 99, 37]), from_list([12, 99, 37]));
    5. find element by specific predicate (lst.find(is_even_), );
    6. filter data structure by specific predicate (lst.filter(is_even));
    7. map structure by specific function (lst.map(increment));
    8. reduce â€“ process structure elements to build a return value by specific functions (lst.reduce(sum));
    9. data structure should be a monoid and implement mempty and mconcat functions or methods;
    10. iterator:
for the mutable version in Python style [12, Chapter 7. Classes & Iterators];
for the immutable version by closure [14], see example ahead.
6. Contribution summary for each group member (should be checkable by git log and git blame):
7. Explanation of taken design decisions and analysis;
work demonstration (how to use developed software, how to test it), should be repeatable by an instructor by given command-line
examples;
conclusion.
